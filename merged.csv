"For tutorials, it is very good to let the students search for themselves. However, you shouldn't let them search for too long either. Indeed, your questionnaire mainly concerns the pace of online courses but personally and my friends had a lot of difficulty with the tutorials. Most of the time we came away from the session with just the answer even though we didn't have the mathematical approach. I understand the course with the tutorials, if I don't have the whole process, I won't understand. Also for online courses, what's the point of using a digital format if you have to write down the formulas on the keyboard, it's infeasible, you might as well go to paper format, which is not suitable for everyone",negative,Evaluation

"This working method is very autonomous, this can be good for the courses because it is true that it is difficult to concentrate during a lecture with a large class like ours, this therefore allows you to do the course independently when you wish but it depends but concerning the tutorials, this method was not suitable for me because we were too independent and did not progress at the pace, it was therefore sometimes difficult to understand the corrections because we were not not everyone has the same question.

In addition, we sometimes reworked exercises from the online course, but if you follow the online course, you have already done them so it is a waste of time. I would have liked to have more different dexo (on the same notions but with different statements and subtleties which sometimes change found S, sometimes X, sometimes Q, sometimes V...). Workshop work is a good thing, but the problem is that there is often a gap in the groups because some people take the course online and others rely on the tutorials to understand the course.

However, I think that there is a lack of summary sessions for each course, like a lecture course but which covers the important elements and/or questions and answers regularly, not at the end of the semester (a bit like the review session in the form of a card mental but at the end of each chapter). In addition, I think that the quiz could be on paper, this could allow you to have a few points ahead before the final (from my experience I understood better and succeeded in doing the demonstrations/calculations of the quiz than the final but I didn't get the average and I think that doing it on paper would have allowed me to get the average).", negative,Synthesis
